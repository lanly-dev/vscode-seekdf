# Seekdf
Seekdf helps you search for directories and files based on a given text input. It provides a tree view to display the search results, along with the size of the results. Feeling like your computer is a black hole swallowing files? Let Seekdf be your guide üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüóÇÔ∏è in this digital labyrinth.

My use case: I was looking for a way to hunt down node_modules directories to delete them, save some disk space, and move my old projects to an archive. I was curious about how much disk space I would be saving. I'm sure there are many other apps or commands I could use, but I don't know any.

## Features
- **Seek Directories**: Search for directories within your workspace
- **Seek Files**: Search for files within your workspace
