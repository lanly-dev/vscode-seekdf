# Seekdf
Seekdf helps you search for directories and files with a given text input. It provides a tree view to display the search results, along with the size of the results.

My use case: I was looking for a way to hunt down `node_modules` directories in order to delete them to save disk space and move my old projects to an archive. I was curious how much disk space I would be saving. I'm sure there are many other apps or commands I could use, but I don't know any.

## Features
- **Seek Directories**: Search for directories within your workspace.
- **Seek Files**: Search for files within your workspace.
