Feeling like your computer is a black hole swallowing files? Let Seekdf be your guide üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüóÇÔ∏è in this digital labyrinth.

I was looking for a way to locate and delete node_modules directories to free up disk space before archiving my old projects. I was curious about how much disk space I would be saving. While there are likely other apps or commands I could use, I'm not familiar with them.
